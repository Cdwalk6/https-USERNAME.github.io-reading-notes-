Growth mindet to me means the art of taking failiures and setback as an opportunity to learn and grow instead of giving up
      ##My three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset are:
1. Remind yourself that success is on the opposite side of failiure
2. It is impossible to learn with a fixed mindset
3. The gratification you get from success os greater than the relief you feel from giving up on somthing that is hard
