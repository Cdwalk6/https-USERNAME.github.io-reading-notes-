###### Growth mindet to me means the art of taking failiures and setback as an opportunity to learn and grow instead of giving up
## My three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset are:
1. _Remind yourself that success is on the opposite side of failiure_
2. *It is impossible to learn with a fixed mindset*
3. _The gratification you get from success is greater than the relief you feel from giving up on somthing that is hard_

I no longer fear failiure. As Franklin D Roosevelt said:

>The only thing to fear is
>fear itself
